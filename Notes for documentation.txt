Running mypy for the first time may need installing
Too much type hinting?
Do you type hint self in a class?
Casing conventions?
Use wx.DrawCircle and wx.DrawEllipse? Changed to DrawEllipticArc
What are we going to do about class diagrams?
# type: ignore on import wx
Problem with type hints in tuple deconstruction (page 48)
  x: int, y: int, w: int, h: int = self.EnclosingRectangle()
  doesn't work.
  There's somewhere else you can't do it either but I can't
  remember where.
  Enclose x, y, w, h in ()
Module names should be lowercase (done, but then the from line import Line doesn't work!)
do we need OnAction/ShapeChanged since we don't do anything when they do change?
