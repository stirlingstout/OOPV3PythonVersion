Running mypy for the first time may need installing
Too much type hinting?
Do you type hint self in a class?
Casing conventions?
Use wx.DrawCircle and wx.DrawEllipse? Changed to DrawEllipticArc
What are we going to do about class diagrams?
# type: ignore on import wx
Problem with type hints in tuple deconstruction (page 48)
  x: int, y: int, w: int, h: int = self.EnclosingRectangle()
  doesn't work.
  There's somewhere else you can't do it either but I can't
  remember where (in a for loop I think)
  Enclose x, y, w, h in ()
Module names should be lowercase (done, but then the from line import Line doesn't work!)
do we need OnAction/ShapeChanged since we don't do anything when they do change?
Most common error is forgetting self. or forgetting wx.
When running keep the DOS window visible to see any errors (give example)
Unlike the C#, in CompositeShape.CalculateEnclosingRectangle,
          self._Shape__X1 = min(self.Components(), key=lambda c: min([c.Y1(), c.Y2()]))
          doesn't report the minimum of the minimum of c.Y1() and c.Y2() but rather the
          c which produces the minimum of the minimum of c.Y1() and c.Y2().
